# Crud React
This is the first part of react-crud. Next I am adding the steps to create the app in ubuntu env.

1. Installation:
 - apt install node
 - apt install git
 - apt install npm (this installation also download npx)
 - npx create-react-app react-crud
 - npm i bootstrap reactstrap

2. Init:
 - cd react-crud
 - npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
